These are my slides for my contributed presentation at the 2024 SIAM Annual Metting. My presentation is entitled "A Residual-Based Approach to Boundary-Value Problems for Multiple-Obstacle Acoustic Scattering".

They were produced using Manim CE with Manim Slides. Additional details are in requirements.txt.

## Running the Presentation

To render the slides, run the following command:

```
manim-slides render siam_2024_slides.py -v WARNING Presentation
```

This may take a while.

Once the slides are finished rendering, use the following command to run the presentation in full-screen mode using Manim Slide's built-in presentation software:

```
manim-slides present -F Presentation
```
